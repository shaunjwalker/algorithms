# Algorithms
A project for CIS-320: Data Structures demonstrating experimental, asymptotic, and algorithmic analysis

This project served as a homework for Data Structures my sophomore year of college, it's main purpose being implementations of experimental design and analysis through setting up experiments related to runtime and asymptotic and algorithmic analysis through correctness arguments and runtime analyses in Big-O notation.

## Project Overview
The project includes:
- Three methods of reversing an input array, reverse1, reverse2, and reverse3
- Two methods of merging two sorted input arrays into a new, sorted array, merge1 and merge2

Each algorithm was compared based upon their runtimes.

## Experimental Design
The experimental design of this project involved :
- Choosing values of n, where n is the size of an input array, on which to run each algorithm to obtain sufficient, good, comparable data
- Ensuring that each run of each algorithm was on a new, randomized array
- Ensuring that merge1 and merge2 were run on the exact same randomized array each run
